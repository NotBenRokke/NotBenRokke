- 👋 Hi, I’m @NotBenRokke
- 👀 I’m interested in ... asking my assitants to get me invited into to peoples homes.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning ... how to convince people that garlic and silver are bad for them and that talking long walks at night by themselves is good for them. 
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on ... Developing a lotion that is SPF 1,000,000 and smells like Apple Jax.
- 📫 How to reach me ... At night
